Specifically, we will see how to match pairs of tuples (also called data records or table rows) to determine if they refer to the same real world entity. To do so, we will need labeled examples as input, i.e., tuple pairs which have been annotated as matches or non-matches. This will be used to train a model to explain using supervised learning."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ER0aUiUv7c1W"},"source":["## Step 0.
